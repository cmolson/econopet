 * Synchronizes keyboard and video state between the RP2040 and FPGA.
 * 
 * This function is called periodically to maintain consistent state between
 * the RP2040 (which handles USB keyboard input and video output) and the
 * FPGA (which generates native PET video and injects USB keyboard input).
 * 
 * Operations performed:
 * 
 * 1. Write USB keyboard matrix to FPGA (ADDR_KBD)
 *    - RP2040 scans USB keyboard and updates usb_key_matrix[]
 *    - FPGA reads this to inject key presses when the CPU reads $E812.
 * 
 * 2. Read PET keyboard matrix from FPGA (ADDR_KBD)
 *    - Reads the current PET keyboard state as seen by the CPU.
 *    - This allows RP2040 to know which keys are pressed on the PET keyboard.
 * 
 * 3. Read CRTC registers from FPGA (ADDR_CRTC)
 *    - CRTC (cathode ray tube controller) registers control video timing
 *    - Used by the RP2040 to emulate CRTC when generating DVI/TMDS video
 * 
 * 4. Read graphics mode flag from status register (upper/lower case)
 *    - Used by the RP2040 to renderer characters when generating DVI/TMDS video
